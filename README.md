## Summary
Reading through the Django For APIs book by William S. Vincent (2020). Each folder contains a different project from the book for implementation practice. Practice using the Django framework, python virtual environments, Django Rest Framework, api endpoints, JavaScript (React), related web technology stacks.

## Setup & Usage
Load repository and for each project activate the python environment / run as a local Django server.

## Potential Improvements
...

## Technologies
* Django is a fullstack framework but languages used in these projects primarily include Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
* Django Rest Framework package
* React (JavaScript library)
* Venv is used for Python virtual environments
* Other libraries, packages, and development principles touched on especially with regards to performance and security in Django projects

## Inspiration
Did Django development for my 2nd and 3rd work terms, just starting my 4th work term and going to be developing a production-level Django project for that as well so want to really understand the development process, good design principles, and solid security. This book also provides more of an angle on to other web design principles and architectures other than focusing on just Django itself.

## Sources
Some deviations may occur and examples taken from online but the book is the primary source and I follow the examples within it closely.
